    <h3>Digital Dopamine Crisis: SMARTPHONE- Impact on Nepali Children</h3>
    <div class="date">June 28, 2025</div>
    <div class="content">
        <p>PERSONAL PERSPECTIVE</p>
        <div class="full-content" style="display: block;"> <!-- Ensure this is visible -->
            <p>In the bustling streets of Kathmandu to the remote villages of PYUTHAN Nepal, a silent revolution is taking place. Children as young as 5 years old demand smartphones to eat their meals, teenagers spend entire days glued to screens, and parents find themselves struggling with a generation that seems disconnected from traditional Nepali values. This is the reality of Nepal's digital transformation - a developing nation caught between preserving its cultural heritage and embracing global digital trends.</p>
            
            <p>As we all know, most of the kids in this generation only want to stay solo or in lonely areas. This is all the game of dopamine and depressed social media influential culture. In the context of Nepal, being a developing country, everyone here is influenced by American and European culture. A kid of 5 years needs a phone to eat and do something, everyone has interest to upload their daily life activities to social media because of this influence. This is the common problem that every parent faces now, but the medical reason behind all these things is DOPAMINE. Yes, it's all about dopamine. Dopamine is released in our mind when we do work that is most enjoyable to do, like scrolling phones, laughing over memes, etc. The high release or over-release of dopamine in our mind affects the useful but boring activities in our life, so we have to put ourselves in the discomfort zone rather than staying in comfort.</p>
            
            <p>The collision between traditional Nepal and digital Nepal has created a complex social phenomenon that requires careful examination. Traditional Nepali values emphasized joint family systems, outdoor games like dandi-biyo, community festivals, and respect for elders.</p>
